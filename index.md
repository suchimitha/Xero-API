# Breadwinner API for Xero
{: .fs-9 }


---

## Introduction
Breadwinner global API is used to communicate with Xero via Breadwinner/Salesforce. Requests & Responses are defined in such a way that you can make use of them and form the required things as per the request and get the response.

We have created two Handlers, one is for Request, and another is for Response. They are named as RequestObject and ResponseObject respectively, which are inner classes of BreadwinnerAPI.

Currently, we are providing API to create, update, and fetch operations for Xero Contacts, Invoices, Bills, and Purchase Orders from Salesforce to Xero.

Breadwinner exposes their global apex classes and methods, which can be used in the custom Apex code and design your flow. 

The following are the class and methods.
